/**
 The various reaction functions are used to create feedback reactions for the `cycle` functions. All of
 them take a closure defining a `request` and a closure defining an `effect` that will happen in response
 to a request. The general rule with all of them is that if the `request` closure returns an approprate value,
 the effect closure will receive it. The rules around what an approiate value is depends on the type of the
 request object.

 For this reaction, the request can be any type. If the `request` closure returns nil then `effect` will not
 receive a value. If it contains a value, the effect closure will receive the request.

 - Parameter request: A function that transforms the Output into an Optional Request.
 - Parameter effect: A function that should emit the results of the side effect.
 - Returns: A new function that transforms Observable State into Observable Action.

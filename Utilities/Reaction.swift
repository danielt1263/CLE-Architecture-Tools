/**
 The various reaction functions are used to create feedback reactions for the above `cycle` functions. All of
 them take a closure defining a `request` and a closure defining an `effect` that will happen in response
 to a request. The general rule with all of them is that if the `request` closure returns an approprate value, a
 new effect will be generated with that request. The rules around what an approiate value is depends on the
 type of the request object.

 For this reaction, the request is a collection. If it is empty, no effect will be generated. If it contains at least one
 value, the effect closure will be called with the collection value.

/**
 The various reaction functions are used to create feedback reactions for the `cycle` functions. All of them take a
 closure defining a `Payload` and a closure defining an `effect` that will happen in response to a request. The general
 rule with all of them is that if the `request` closure returns an approprate value, the effect closure will receive
 it. The rules around what an approiate value is depends on the type of the request object.
